                <p class="descr">First chose device from the dropdown list, then you can remove the selected device type from database
                   if you'd like to make updates (Note: the device records relative to the device type to be deleted will not be affected
                     in the database, however, you can delete device records manually later in assemble window then re-create new ones).</p>

                    from <strong>dropdown list</strong> then click" <strong>"Confirm"</strong> to start assembling with chosen device type.</p>

                <h2>Add new device type:</h2>
                <p class="descr">When you are in "Add new device type window", you can create new device type by providing
                device's name and its component names that requires SN to be recorded.</p>

                <p class="descr">Once the device type is confirmed, you will be transferred to record SN page, where by
                    giving the device SN:</p>

                        <p class="descr"> Otherwise if the device record has been added in the database already, the program will fetch and fill the 
                            recorded SN automatically, where afterwards you can either add or update new SN (Note: be aware that you
                            will need to provide <strong>reasons</strong> for why any <strong>new SN updates</strong> are necessary if some component has replaced, 
                            and your name, previse & new SN and timestamp of the operation will be recorded):</p>

                <p class="descr">Before you are test/qc/packing the device, you will need to have test/qc/pack check cases file ready first,
                    where samples can be found in <strong>"test_cases"</strong> folder. Follow the instructions to
                    make new <strong>"device_name.xls"</strong> file which contains test/qc/pack check cases readable by the program,
                    where in short the rules are:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Name the excel file: device_name + .xls</li>
                    <li>In excel file, fill 1st row: category titles</li>
                    <li>And fill 2nd - onwards: descriptions of sub-cases</li>
                    <li>COL 1 is reserved for TEST</li>

                    all <strong>Test cases</strong> are checked. Where warnings will also pop out to notify the QC staff for if there's
                    any SN update history as well.

                    both <strong>Test & QC cases</strong> are all checked. Where you may also be required to take device front/back pictures
                    to prove the metal work of the device before packing is in perfect condition. <br>
                    And when the computer is connected with multiple cameras, you can also switch the camera by altering camera index.
